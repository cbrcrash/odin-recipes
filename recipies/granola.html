    <h1>Bacteria-Boosting Granola</h1>
    <img src="../img/granola.jpeg" alt="Granola and Berries">
    <p>Store-bought granola usually has an overabundance of added sugar, 
        which is unfortunate because granola has great potential for supporting 
        microbiota health. This recipe keeps all the great dietary fiber but 
        eliminates much of the added sugar. To keep it interesting throughout 
        the year, we often add seasonal fruit when we eat the granola.</p>
